      "\n",
      "A) The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a phenomenon that occurs when large swirls of plasma travel along the edge of the magnetosphere at a different velocity from the magnetosphere, causing the plasma to slip past. This results in magnetic reconnection, and as the magnetic field lines break and reconnect, solar wind particles are able to enter the magnetosphere.\n",
      "B) The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a phenomenon that occurs when the magnetosphere is compared to a sieve because it allows solar wind particles to enter.\n",
      "C) The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a phenomenon that occurs when Earth's bow shock is about 17 kilometers (11 mi) thick and located about 90,000 kilometers (56,000 mi) from Earth.\n",
      "D) The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a phenomenon that occurs when the magnetic field extends in the magnetotail on Earth's nightside, which lengthwise exceeds 6,300,000 kilometers (3,900,000 mi).\n",
      "E) The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a phenomenon that occurs when the magnetosphere is compressed by the solar wind to a distance of approximately 65,000 kilometers (40,000 mi) on the dayside of Earth. This results in the magnetopause existing at a distance of several hundred kilometers above Earth's surface.\n",
